Welcome to the 3D Geometry Visualizer repository, a collection of resources for interactive visualization and exploration of computer vision concepts. The repository is structured into two main parts: 
1. `Plot3D.py`: The Plot3D module is a library for creating interactive 3D plots. This library, inspired by Wolfram Mathematica, aims to provide a toolset for visualizing and validating fundamental concepts in computer vision such as camera models, epipolar geometry, and more.
3. `3D_geometry.ipynb`: This notebook is my study note that covers some computer vision topics. It includes camera models, epipolar geometry, the fundamentals matrix, the method of triangulation, etc. Alongside theoretical derivations, this notebook offers visualization of 3D objects, aiding in the understanding of these topics.
